# PythonProject: Password Manager

## Description

I chose to create a Password Manager with CSV Storage where the user will have the options to 

1. Create a new password.
2. Delete an existing password. 
3. retrieve an existing password. 
4. update an existing password. 

The user will be able to run -h to display all the options provided by the source code. It was programed to only show the options and exit. 
all using a command line interface and store in a CSV. It should display a message whether the password was created, deleted, retrieved, or updated, and if it failed as well. 
The test file has a testing section to each function and should have annotation along the way to guide you. 

Side note: This is my last school project as I am graduating by the end of the week. It was a pleasure working with you. Hope you have a great summer!
